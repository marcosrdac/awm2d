# To do  

- [X] solve wave equation
- [X] add taper
- [X] save time snaps to binary file
- [X] get a better taper
- [X] generate synthetic data
- [X] make reverse propagation
- [X] image condition
- [X] subtract direct wave from seismogram before reverse propagation
- [X] create a module wave equation solving and related stuff
- [X] create specific code for 1D/2D signal propagation w/ and w/o saving
- [X] read velocity field from binary file
- [X] read signal from binary file
- [X] dx != dz
- [X] different laplacian orders
- [X] Signal1d/Signal2d -> Vector{Signal1d}(n_sources)
- [X] code cleanup
- [ ] sourceposition --> local offsets (source position, n_recept., spacing, array)
- [ ] generate local offset --> one shot
- [ ] generate local offset --> various shots
- [.] madagascar for julia: sadly, it yet doesn't exist
