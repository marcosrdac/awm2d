# To do  

## Now
- [X] solve wave equation
- [X] add taper
- [X] save time snaps to binary file
- [X] get a better taper
- [X] generate synthetic data
- [X] make reverse propagation
- [X] image condition
- [X] subtract direct wave from seismogram before reverse propagation
- [X] create a wave equation module for solving and related stuff
- [X] create specific code for 1D/2D signal propagation w/ and w/o saving
- [X] read velocity field from binary file
- [X] read signal from binary file
- [X] dx != dz
- [X] different laplacian orders
- [X] Signal1d/Signal2d -> Vector{Signal1d}(n_sources)
- [X] code cleanup
- [X] receptors position --> local offsets (source position, n_recept., spacing, array)
- [X] generate synthetic wavelets --> one shot
- [X] generate synthetic wavelets --> various shots
- [X] make complete migration routine
- [X] adjust overhead
- [.] madagascar for julia: sadly, it yet doesn't exist
- [ ] read articles:
  - [ ] ...
- [ ] train neural network with 1 propagation cube

## Future
- [ ] create database
  - [ ] create various velocity fields
  - [ ] propagate signals into the velocity fields
- [ ] read data and format it to
